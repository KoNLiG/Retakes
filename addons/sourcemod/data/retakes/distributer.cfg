//	   - awp				:: High risk and high reward, the infamous AWP is recognizable by its signature report and one-shot, one-kill policy.
//	   - usp_silencer		:: The Silenced USP Pistol has a detachable silencer that gives shots less recoil while suppressing attention-getting noise.

//	   - flashbang			:: The Flashbang grenade temporarily blinds anybody within its concussive blast, making it perfect for flushing out closed-in areas.
//	   - hegrenade			:: The high explosive fragmentation grenade administers high damage through a wide area, making it ideal for clearing out hostile rooms.
